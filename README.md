# intercom-integration-esp8266-platformio
A tiny RESTfull API for opening an old intercom that has to emulate reciever pick-up and after setupable delay closing the physical gate circuit.


# Already found-out:

-intercom has all-time on 9V supply lines  
-[SSR relay datasheet](https://omronfs.omron.com/en_US/ecb/products/pdf/en-g3mc.pdf) (I got the and they're small - if I'll need I'll swap that for a mechanical one, the goal is so that it is small enough to put it into the oryginal intercom case

# ToDo:

-make a fritzing schematic  
-find out the current going through the phycisal gate circuit when opening the gate  
-add platformio code  
-add dockerization or sth other aiming for the average computer-user friendliness level  
-post photos of the intercom circuit and case  
-multi WiFi credentials  
-HTTPS letsenrypt â†’ Wemos ?  

# REST End-points:

- GET: /open  > get method for easier cli integration like so: ```curl 192.168.1.101/open```
- GET: /health  
- PUT: /delay_ms?t=500  
- PUT: /pulse_length_ms?t=500  
- GET: /restart
- PUT: /OTA/address?a="http://lepi.pl/OTA/RPLUS-intercom"
- GET: /OTA/reload > check for updates at address


# MarkDown playground:
```Python
print(x)
```
